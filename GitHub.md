- 13 June 2021 - Log Update 1 :  
   - I Learned how to use markdown language commands  
   - Some Important commands: "  " : double spaces to break line/to go to below/next line or paragragh;  Headings by using "#" ;  And ** Text ** : to make a text bolder.  
   - On using the command double stars(shift+8), No matter what text you put in between these two stars(shift+8) they get converted italics which is one of my favorite font style to write with.  
   - Test 1 for sub listing format (bring the dash sign under the First letter of the previous line)
   - ***Test 2 for Bold Italics(triple stars on both ends)***
