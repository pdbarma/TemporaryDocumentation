### HTML 5 :

- new version of html
- The term HTML5 is essentially a buzzword that refers to a set of modern web technologies.
This includes the HTML Living Standard, along with JavaScript APIs to enhance storage, multimedia, and hardware access.
- [HTML Standards](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#toc-introduction)

### BLOCK VS INFINITE LINE:DIV & SPAN :

- Divs``` <div></div> ```are generic containers to group elements together.
- span ``` <span></span>```are another generic container but it is an inline element.
- It is a block level element.
  - **What is a block element?**
    - HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) elements historically were categorized as either "block-level" elements or "inline-level" elements. Since this is a presentational characteristic it is nowadays specified by CSS in the Flow Layout. A Block-level element occupies the entire horizontal space of its parent element (container), and vertical space equal to the height of its contents, thereby creating a "block".

 #### Block-level vs. inline
There are a couple of key differences between block-level elements and inline elements:

- Content model
Generally, block-level elements may contain inline elements and (sometimes) other block-level elements. Inherent in this structural distinction is the idea that block elements create "larger" structures than inline elements.

- Default formatting
By default, block-level elements begin on new lines, but inline elements can start anywhere in a line.
