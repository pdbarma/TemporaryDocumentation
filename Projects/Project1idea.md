5V5 moba battle
Maps with traps and item respawn
Black body characters : Male & female.
Zombie based traps
players at certain level will be able to create a group of 5 members. 
Characters are the shadow of their original body and they have to use this shadowed body to build/complete their base before a wave of zombie floods in and the resources are limited.
You have to fight and collect the resoures to build your camp/base and protect your team.
In the arena players will have to kill their opponents and collect the limited resources. After dying, they will be respawned after a timelimit. 
Players can destroy/degrade their opponent's base
